Simple CRUD Application with GUI

In this code we create an application that has 3 features: add user, edit user and delete user.
When we click on add button we are required to insert some information about user, while his unique id is automatically generated.
After adding, we can edit every user by simply double clicking him on the list or marking him and clicking edit button.
We can delete an user by clicking on delete button.
